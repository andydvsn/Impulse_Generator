Impulse Generator
=================

Solid-state alternative to traditional electric master clocks.


Introduction
------------

This project aims to replicate the function of traditional electric master clocks such as the Gents C7 or GPO Type 36. Combining the extremely accurate DS3231 real time clock and an ATmega microcontroller on a custom board, pulses are generated every one, six and thirty seconds by switching 2N2222 transistors.

The purpose is to allow those without an electric master clock to make use of dials that require these timing pulses to operate, or for use where running a mechanical master clock constantly may be impractical.
